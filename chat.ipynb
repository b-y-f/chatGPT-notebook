She had ordered a pair of shoes (size 7, order number 130129) online on December 26th, 2022, and attached her receipt. Unfortunately, she received an odd pair consisting of a left shoe in size 7 and a right shoe in size 8. She contacted customer service for an exchange, but only received an automated email response and no further solutions. After waiting for over three months, she decided to visit our physical store for help.\n",

If so, please help us balance the stock\n"
